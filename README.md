# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project is a movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to your favorite one based on genre similarity. It utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains information on 4800 movies, including their titles, genres, and other metadata. The system works by calculating similarity scores between movies using the genres associated with them. Based on these scores, it ranks and recommends a list of movies that share similar genres with the selected movie.

The recommendation process helps users discover movies they might enjoy based on the genre of a movie they already like. The dataset's large variety ensures that the system can provide accurate and relevant recommendations across different movie categories. This project can be extended by integrating additional features such as filtering by release year, popularity, or user ratings for a more personalized experience.
